MIPS Calculator - version 0.01

This will eventually be a readme for our calculator thingy...

In the meantime! If you don't know how to GIT, here is the process to add files to the repository:
1. git add filename.txt   
2. git commit -a-m "commit message"
3. git push origin master
(if 3 gives you an error message, write git pull, hit enter, and then do the push again)

In order to make sure that everyone is following the same conventions, here are some ground rules.
  User input will be limited to 96 bits
    This means that in order to have two user inputted numbers, we need six registers to store the numbers in. The first number entered will be stored in regiters $t0 - $t2, and the second entered will be in $t3 - $t5.
  The operator (+, -, *, etc) will be in $t6 (EDIT: This is no longer true. The operator will be stored in a 64 bit array that can be accessed at the address theOperator.)
  The result will go in the $s registers, starting at $s0, with a maximum size of 128 bits.
  The most significant bits will go in the lower numbered registers. (MSB for userInput1 goes in $t0)


So it looks like the registers can hold up to 18446744073709552000 or 0xffffffffffffffff (that's 16 fs), which is a total of 64 bits.
But you can only input up to 32767 (2^15 - 1) because apparently it reads numbers in as signed.
